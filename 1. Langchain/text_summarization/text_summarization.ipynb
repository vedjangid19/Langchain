    "People across the country, involved in government, political, and social activities, are dedicating their time to make the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ (Developed India Resolution Journey) successful. Therefore, as a Member of Parliament, it was my responsibility to also contribute my time to this program. So, today, I have come here just as a Member of Parliament and your ‘sevak’, ready to participate in this program, much like you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our country, governments have come and gone, numerous schemes have been formulated, discussions have taken place, and big promises have been made. However, my experience and observations led me to believe that the most critical aspect that requires attention is ensuring that the government’s plans reach the intended beneficiaries without any hassles. If there is a ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ (Prime Minister’s housing scheme), then those who are living in jhuggis and slums should get their houses. And he should not need to make rounds of the government offices for this purpose. The government should reach him. Since you have assigned this responsibility to me, about four crore families have got their ‘pucca’ houses. However, I have encountered cases where someone is left out of the government benefits. Therefore, I have decided to tour the country again, to listen to people’s experiences with government schemes, to understand whether they received the intended benefits, and to ensure that the programs are reaching everyone as planned without paying any bribes. We will get the real picture if we visit them again. Therefore, this ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination. I want to hear from you and the people across the country whether what I envisioned and the work I have been doing aligns with reality and whether it has reached those for whom it was meant.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to check whether the work that was supposed to happen has indeed taken place. I recently met some individuals who utilized the Ayushman card to get treatment for serious illnesses. One person met with a severe accident, and after using the card, he could afford the necessary operation, and now he is recovering well. When I asked him, he said: “How could I afford this treatment? Now that there is the Ayushman card, I mustered courage and underwent an operation. Now I am perfectly fine.”  Such stories are blessings to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bureaucrats, who prepare good schemes, expedite the paperwork and even allocate funds, also feel satisfied that 50 or 100 people who were supposed to get the funds have got it. The funds meant for a thousand villages have been released. But their job satisfaction peaks when they hear that their work has directly impacted someone’s life positively. When they see the tangible results of their efforts, their enthusiasm multiplies. They feel satisfied. Therefore, ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ has had a positive impact on government officers. It has made them more enthusiastic about their work, especially when they witness the tangible benefits reaching the people. Officers now feel satisfied with their work, saying, “I made a good plan, I created a file, and the intended beneficiaries received the benefits.” When they find that the money has reached a poor widow under the Jeevan Jyoti scheme and it was a great help to her during her crisis, they realise that they have done a good job. When a government officer listens to such stories, he feels very satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are very few who understand the power and impact of the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’. When I hear people connected to bureaucratic circles talking about it, expressing their satisfaction, it resonates with me. I’ve heard stories where someone suddenly received 2 lakh rupees after the death of her husband, and a sister mentioned how the arrival of gas in her home transformed her lives. The most significant aspect is when someone says that the line between rich and poor has vanished. While the slogan ‘Garibi Hatao’ (Remove Poverty) is one thing, but the real change happens when a person says, “As soon as the gas stove came to my house, the distinction between poverty and affluence disappeared.\n",

He emphasizes the importance of accelerating development to fulfill the aspirations of the youth, outlining key messages gleaned from his interactions.\\n\\nKalam is deeply moved by the desire of India\\'s youth, symbolized by a young girl named Anukriti who asked him why India couldn\\'t become a developed nation before 2020. This question, echoed by over fifteen lakh youth he has met, underlines the urgency for progress. A visit to Nagaland reinforced this, where he witnessed the potential of rural India, but also the need for better connectivity to bring prosperity to villages. Additionally, Kalam describes meeting over 6000 farmers from different states who shared their insights and concerns. He underscores the importance of agriculture as the backbone of the nation, calling for a \"second green revolution\" through sustainable practices and empowering farmers to protect and nurture the land.  He believes this will lead to a significant increase in agricultural GDP growth.  \\n\\nHe calls for empowering villages, mobilizing rural resources, strengthening agriculture, overcoming problems through partnership and courage, establishing connectivity for societal transformation, defending the nation, and fostering a youth movement for a developed India by 2020. This vision is deeply personal, inspired by Anukriti\\'s question and the shared dream of India\\'s 540 million youth for a prosperous, safe, and proud nation. Kalam believes that India can achieve this goal well before 2020, citing the hard work and dedication of its people.  He envisions a nation where his vision encompasses:\\n\\n* **A Nation where poverty has been totally eradicated, illiteracy removed and crimes against women and children are absent.**\\n* **A Nation where the rural and urban divide is minimized.**\\n* **A Nation where energy and water are equitably distributed.**\\n* **A Nation where agriculture, industry, and services work in harmony.**\\n* **A Nation where education with value system is not denied to any meritorious candidates because of societal or economic discrimination.**\\n* **A Nation which is the best destination for the most talented scholars, scientists, and investors.**\\n* **A Nation where the best of health care is available to all.**\\n* **A Nation where governance is responsive, transparent and corruption free.**\\n* **A Nation that is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful and happy and continues with a sustainable growth path.** \\n* **A Nation that is one of the best places to live in and is proud of its leadership.**\\n\\nTo achieve this vision, Kalam cites the PURA initiative as a concrete example. He describes how the Periyar PURA complex successfully brought physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity to 65 villages, leading to economic growth, job creation, and sustainable development. This model, Kalam argues, can be replicated across India to transform rural areas and empower the nation\\'s youth.  \\n\\nHe also highlights the potential for international collaboration, referencing his proposal for the Pan African e-Network to connect 53 African countries through tele-education and tele-medicine, noting that tele-medicine in Ethiopia has already been commissioned and the Indira Gandhi National Open University is providing MBA courses to Ethiopian students.  He further details the Pan African project, emphasizing that it will connect the Heads of State of all 53 African countries for instant communication, bringing societal transformation to the continent. \\n\\nAs an example of a youth movement already taking shape, Kalam shares his experience meeting a group in Hyderabad dedicated to transforming youth into enlightened citizens. The Lead India 2020 Foundation, founded by Dr. N.B. Sudershan, is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Administration.  He cites the positive impact this training has had on students in Medak district, noting improvements in self-discipline, family values, and civic responsibility. Kalam even shares the story of Ms. Padma, a student leader who used her training to help her father quit smoking. \\n\\nKalam also touches on instances of courage and resilience, recounting his visit to Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir after the devastating earthquake in 2005 and his visit to Chuckchucha village in Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami. He was deeply moved by the villagers\\' bravery and their active participation in the relief operations, even while dealing with immense loss.  He composed a poem, \"Sea Waves,\" recognizing the islanders\\' courage and unity in the face of tragedy.  \\n\\nHe expresses his pride in the Indian Armed Forces through personal experiences at Siachen Glacier, INS Sindhurakshak, and flying in a Sukhoi-30, highlighting their dedication and service in challenging conditions.  He also shares his admiration for the para-military forces, central and state police personnel, and internal security forces who work tirelessly to ensure the safety and security of India\\'s citizens.   \\n\\nKalam concludes by emphasizing the importance of preserving India\\'s rich cultural heritage while continuing to strive for economic growth. He believes that with the hard work and dedication of its people, India has the potential to become a developed nation well before 2020.  He believes in the power of dreams and aspirations, especially those of the youth, stating that if they aim high, they will undoubtedly come close to achieving their goals.  He ends by sharing his mission: to connect the billion hearts and minds of the people of India and instill in them the confidence to achieve anything.  \\n\\n\\n\\n'"
